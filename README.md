# IconSelectorPreference

A library for quickly implementing a ListPreference in Android which shows an icon for each selection. I couldn't find any good resources on how to do this, so I wrote this library that impelements everything for you.

To use, simply create a class that extends from IconListPreference, and be sure to call this.setIconFileNamesArray in the constructor.
